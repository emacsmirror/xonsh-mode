* xonsh-mode

Emacs major mode for editing [[https://xon.sh][xonshrc]] files. This mode inherits from
=python-mode= but adds specific =xonsh= syntax.

* Installation

For now just copy the xonsh-mode.el file to your ~/.emacs.d/elisp/
folder and then make sure the following line is executed on startup:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/elisp/")
#+end_src

Which if you are using the scheme above would be in the
~/.emacs.d/init.el folder.
